# Base_10_to_Binary
simple python base 10 to binary conversion

I have already made the majority of this project before I had a github, but it took me about a whole day and it works well, so I put it on here in case anyone wants to see it.  I used this as a sort of learning tool as I was still learning how to code practically, rather than theoretically.
